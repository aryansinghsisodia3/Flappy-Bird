# Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird is a 2013 casual mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen (Vietnamese: Nguyễn Hà Đông), under his game development company.Gears.[1] The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, Faby, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The player's score is determined by the number of pipes they pass. Nguyen created the game over several days, using the bird from a cancelled game made in 2012.
